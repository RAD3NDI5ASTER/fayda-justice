# FaydaJustice – Digital Court & Legal Services Tracker

## 🧠 Project Synopsis

### 🔍 Problem Statement
Ethiopia's legal and court systems are largely paper-based, leading to:
- Delayed case resolutions
- Citizens not knowing their case status
- No central dashboard for court administrators
- High potential for lost files, corruption, and inefficiencies

### 💡 Planned Solution
FaydaJustice is a secure web-based platform that allows:
- **Citizens** to log in with their Fayda national ID (VeriFayda OIDC)
- **Court officials** to manage and view digital case records
- **All users** to track court dates, case types, progress, and outcomes
- A **central dashboard** with filters (region, court type, pending/resolved)

We will simulate/mock legal case data for demo purposes in the hackathon.

### 🎯 Expected Outcome
- Reduce physical visits to court for updates
- Improve public trust and transparency
- Provide officials with data-driven insights
- Enable faster decision-making and better caseload management

### 🏛️ Fayda's Role
- Fayda provides **secure and verified national ID login**
- Every user interaction is trusted and traceable via OIDC
- Fayda ensures **only verified citizens or court staff** access records
